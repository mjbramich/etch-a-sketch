## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

First of all i created all the HTML using JavaScript. From there i created a grid using a loop and filled the grid with cells, to make the cells fit inside of the grid i used flexbox. To change the color of each cell, i added an event listener to the grid, so when a user clicks on a cell the color is updated. 

## Optimizations
